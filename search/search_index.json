If two images contain the same object but at different positions, a linear classifier on raw pixels fails because translation moves the pattern across the grid. Better features include color histograms and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG).

For a node with inputs (x, y) and output z, each node performs a simple operation; its local gradients \\(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\) are easy to compute. Once we have \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z}\\) from downstream, the chain rule gives \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial z} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\), which is then passed to the previous node.</p> <p>Each node keeps and passes on its local gradient.
