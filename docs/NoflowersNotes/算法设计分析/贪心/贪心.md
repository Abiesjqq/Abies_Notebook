## Hard Problem

**The Partition Problem**: Get a partition of num-set $S$ such that $\sum_{S_1}x = \sum_{S_2}x$ --> NP hard. (Proof later)

"Homework ++": given a set of tasks with release time $r_i$, duration $s_i$ and DDL $d_i$, find a arrangement to complete them.

!!! remarks "Prove Homework ++ is harder than partition"
    Given the partition input $\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$, let $w = \sum a_i$  
    $n + 1$ homeworks, the first $n$ represents $a_1, \ldots, a_n$, each has release time $0$, DDL $w + 1$, and size $a_i$.  
    And the last homework has release time $w / 2$, DDL $w / 2 + 1$ and size $1$, so it must start at time $w / 2$.  
    Then the arrangement of the other tasks is a partition problem!

## Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

Definition and algorithms were introduced in discrete math, omitted.

### Prim Algorithm

Add a node into the tree each time. Exactly, from a vertex, add a node into the tree with the closest edge weight.

```
# Initialize
T = {}, S = {}
cost[r] = 0, cost[v] = inf for v other than r
for r's neighbour v: cost[v] = w(r, v), pre[v] = r

# Recurse
while:
    find v not in S with smallest cost[v]
    S = S + {v}, T = T + {(pre[v], v)}
    
    # update
    for v's neighbour u:
        cost[u] = min(cost[u], w(u, v))
        if cost[u] was updated, pre[u] = v
```

With Fibonacci heap, we have $O(\vert E \vert + \vert V \vert \log \vert V \vert)$

### Kruskal's Algorithm

Add an edge between the vertices each time. Exactly, sorting the edges and choose a shortest edge which will not form a cycle and add it into the tree edges.
