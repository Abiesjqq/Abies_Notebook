# Lecture 01 Overview of Computer Graphics

## Basic Concepts

**Rasterization**

1. Project geometry primitives (3DD triangles / polygons) onto the screen.
2. Break projected primitives into fragments (pixels)
3. Real-time applications is the gold standard in Video Games

??? note "translation"

    1. 将几何形状（3D 三角形/多边形）投影到屏幕上
    2. 将投影后的图元划分为片段（像素）
    3. 在视频游戏中，事事应用是黄金标准

**Curves and Meshes**

**Ray Tracing**

Shoot rays from camera through each pixel
Offline application is the gold standard in Animation / Movies

**Animation / Simulation**

**Difference between Computer Graphics and Computer Vision?**
